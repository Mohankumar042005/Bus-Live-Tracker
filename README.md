# Bus-Live-Tracker
Bus live tracker system using python and firebase
A Bus Tracker is a web-based real-time tracking system that allows users to view the live location of buses on a map, based on their selected source (From) and destination (To). It uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and update GPS coordinates of buses and Google Maps API to visually display the bus movement on the map interface.
